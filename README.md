Krypto 
===========

Build notes:

	- Included xcode project is designed to allow debugging of tests with Xcode debugger
	- Static library will be generated by krypto-lib and gradle is the ultimate authority on whether tests are passing
	- Currently, builds are for both x86 and x64. Unless we plan on supporting 32-bit builds we should remove this as it causes mysterious failures when 32-bit developer libraries are unavailable. Fix: `apt-get install libc6-dev-i386`
