Building
==========

Use gradle to build with ``./gradlew build``

Testing
==========

Building will run all the unit tests in src/mainTest/cpp using the google-test framework. Do not modify test_main.cpp or add a main() function to any test script. Follow the format of test_trivial.cpp

Test results are published to build/test-results and can be viewed within Eclipse by opening the xml results file.
