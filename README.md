Krypto 
===========

## Getting Started

Make sure everything is working correctly. 

For mac:

	> ./gradlew buildGoogleTestMac :krypto-lib:build

For linux:

	> ./gradlew buildGoogleTest :krypto-lib:build
	
Builds currently depend on clang3.7 for c++14 features. This is only tends to be an issue on older versions of linux.

The easiest way to do development is to use the included xcode projects which are setup such that GoogleTests can be debugged from within XCode by using the krypto-cli project.

## Build Notes

	- Included xcode project is designed to allow debugging of tests with Xcode debugger
	- Static library will be generated by krypto-lib and gradle is the ultimate authority on whether tests are passing
